# GoToDnSpy

## Introduction

Sometimes I need something command like Resharper has "Navigate To Decompiled Sources", but I don't want to buy and install it only for this command. So I created this plugin for quick access to dnSpy.
BTW, for now, VS 2017.6 Preview can do it with ILSpy.


[dnSpy](https://github.com/0xd4d/dnSpy/) is the best tool for .net reseacher.
You can [download latest dnSpy build](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/0xd4d/dnspy/branch/master/artifacts) from CI.

## Installing

Plugin can be found in [Visual Studio marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/vsgallery/02d8452f-a0ec-4cbc-adc7-d050c0f43d54).

**Please send positive feedback if you liked the extension :)**
